#Lecture 14: 
###for exam prep:
- onlien script
- online quiz (linked in olat-> programme)
- monster tutorial: first week of jan!
- can have a cheet sheet for exam
  - write per hand (front and back) otherwise just front
  - 1 A4 paper
  - think and then implement
  - nltk not part of the exam & word net synonyms (only functionality)


##Measuring Computing Time and Memory Consumption
- timimg starts when the function is called
- 1 = run once
  - should run multiple times to get a good avg
- ps = process status command
- list comprehension takes more memory to generator () but about same time! => matters which is used!
  - especially when large datasets


##Rounding
- round(num, to what decimal)
- sometimes according to school rules and sometimes not
  - => read the link


P.5: Assignment
a = 5*8
1) evaluating the right han d side of operator = creating an object, single address of the data
2) name that value, assigns a to that adress
with c=b
1) c also point to where b was pointing/ to the same object / memory address
when multiple assignments to the same variable:
1) creates int
2) assigns it name d
3) binds same object to another name
4) rebinidng the name to a new object (old binding of d is forgotten)
a,b = b,1

=> right han sside gets evaluated and then assigned to a variable!

- what it means to point to the same object in RAM:
  - different names are reffering to the same object in the memory
  - ID gives the memeroy address => integer
    - unique
  - P.7: theyre not the same object! they have different addresses
  - list increment means we are concatinating the list => adress stays same
    - bc this datasrructure is mutable!
  - string increment: new id
    - beware of garbage data => should be freed => garbage collector
      - python keeps counter, if it cannot be accessed anymore, it deltes it

-equality evaluates 
    if true: same value
- "is" compares the ids of the 2 arguments
- loop binding does not create copies (?)
- deepcopy() means we copy everything EVERYTHINg
